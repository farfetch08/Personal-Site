          <p>
            As a JavaScript developer, I am responsible for creating and implementing the dynamic and interactive features of websites and web applications.

          <h3>Talk to people</h3>
          <p>
            As a frontend developer, I believe that creating visually appealing websites is only half the battle. A website's success also depends on its ability to connect with users and foster lasting relationships. This is why I prioritize integrating contact forms and chat features into my designs, making it easier for users to communicate with website owners or support teams.
